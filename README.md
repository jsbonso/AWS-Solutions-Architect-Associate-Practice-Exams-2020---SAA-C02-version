The AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate is consistently among the top-paying IT certifications in the world, considering that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leading cloud services platform in the world with almost 50% market share! Earn over $150,000 per year with an AWS Solutions Architect certification!

But before you become an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional, it is recommended for you to pass the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification exam first, and this is where AWS practice tests come in. It is possible that you have read all of the available AWS documentation online yet still fail the exam! These AWS practice tests simulate the actual certification exam and ensure that you indeed understand the subject matter.

This AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Practice Exam course is for anyone who is looking for a study material that provides the following:

These AWS Solutions Architect practice exams are designed to focus on the important exam topics (such as EC2, EBS, S3, and many others) hence, the aforementioned topics have more questions than the other AWS knowledge areas. The number of questions on each topic is carefully selected based on the 5 domains of the actual AWS certification exam. Out of the 5 domains, Domain 1: Design Resilient Architectures has the highest percentage (34%) with topics such as reliable and/or resilient storage; how to design decoupling mechanisms; determine how to design multi-tier, fault-tolerant architectures, etc. Note that although there is a focus on these AWS topics, the questions are all still unique, to ensure that you fully grasp the concepts.

Some people are using brain dumps for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect certification exam which is totally absurd and highly unprofessional because these dumps will not only hinder you to attain an in-depth AWS knowledge, these can also result with you failing the actual AWS certification exam since Amazon regularly updates the exam coverage.

Please also note that these AWS Certified Solutions Architect practice tests are not exam dumps and since Amazon shuffles the actual exam content from a question bank with hundreds to thousands of questions, it is nearly impossible to match what you can see here with the actual tests. Again, the key to passing the exam is a good understanding of AWS services and this is what our AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate practice tests are meant to do.

There are a lot of existing AWS Practice Tests in the market however, most of them contain both technical and grammatical errors that may cause you to fail the actual exam. There are also official certification practice exams provided by AWS but these only have 20 or 40 questions and cost 20 or 30 USD -- a price that is comparable with having these 390 Unique and Timed Amazon Web Services practice questions!

When I was reviewing for my AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam, I had a hard time finding comprehensive practice tests to help me pass my exam. I bought some of them in the market but I was disappointed because there are a lot of technical and grammatical errors in the questions. This is why I created these AWS practice tests to help my fellow IT professionals in the industry.
